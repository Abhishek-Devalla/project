Implemented an end-to-end AdventureWorks data engineering project on Azure, building scalable ETL pipelines
using Azure Data Factory, Databricks (PySpark), Azure Data Lake, and Azure Synapse Analytics to trans-
form raw transactional data into analytics-ready tables for reporting and business insights. Designed a modern
medallion architecture (bronze–silver–gold layers) with parameterized pipelines, data quality checks, and opti-
mized Parquet/Delta storage to improve reliability, query performance, and maintainability of enterprise-scale
sales and customer analytics workloads
